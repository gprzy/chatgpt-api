        "prompt": "Now can you tell me the answer in miliseconds?",
        "answer": "One millisecond (ms) is equivalent to 1/1000th of a second. If we want to convert a larger unit of time, such as seconds or minutes, to milliseconds, we would simply multiply by 1000. For example, one second is equivalent to 1000 milliseconds (1 x 1000) and one minute is equivalent to 60,000 milliseconds (60 x 1000). So, I need to know what unit of time you want me to convert to milliseconds."
